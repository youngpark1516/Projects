# Kernels
## Introduction
This mini project is an extension from the data science classes I took in UCSD in second quarter of freshman year, DSC20 and DSC96, in which the final projects both involved the process of manipulating images through kernels. 

In the project of DSC20, the project involved creating class methods applying edge detection and blurring, while the project of DSC96 involved using the sharpening kernel. Having developed a light interest in these methods of manipulating images through kernels for various purposes, this simple project was thought of and executed.
